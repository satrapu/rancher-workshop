# rancher-workshop
This repo contains the materials used by the "Rancher Workshop" session which took place in Cluj-Napoca on September 7th 2017, during the "Java Technical Group Day #5" iQuest internal event. 

These materials have been created for [iQuest](http://www.iquestgroup.com/en/), but this company has been kind enough to open source them.  
Kudos, iQuest!
