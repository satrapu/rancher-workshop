# Rancher Workshop
This repo contains the materials used during the "Rancher Workshop" session, which took place in Cluj-Napoca on September 7th 2017, as part of the "Java Technical Group Day #5" iQuest internal event.  
The purpose of this workshop is to provide a basic understanding of [Rancher v1.x](https://rancher.com/), a Docker container management platform.  
Initially, the workshop was meant for in-house training, but was later open-sourced with the help of iQuest Java Practice leadership.
